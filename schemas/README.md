i am unsure yet if each directory should have its own schema.js file or everything should be in its own directory 

schemas specify the fields, their data types (such as String, Number, Date, Boolean, ObjectId, etc.), default values, validation rules, and other constraints.
This structured approach ensures consistency in data format and facilitates efficient querying and manipulation of data.
