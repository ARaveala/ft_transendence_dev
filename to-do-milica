– JWT tokens am i going to use them
– in relation to backend frontend what do i need

– prometheus, grafana, kabana,
– hashivault, firewall



1. set up a dummy container
    simple webserver (somewhere where we can read the requests)
2. set up nginx reverse proxy
    to forward everything to the dummy
3. set up the WAF
    clone the modsecurity repo, script built
    only clone the repo when it's not in the volume already
    same thing for the connector
    volume for the container where the waf is so only the volume will be cloned if there is a change and not everytime
    same container as the nginx reverse proxy 
    do filtering there
4. hashivault

later
replace the nginx image with a base image (alpine prolly)
